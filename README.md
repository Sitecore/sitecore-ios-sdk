Sitecore Mobile SDK 2.0 for iOS
======================================

Sitecore Mobile SDK is a framework that is designed to help the developer produce iOS based applications that use and serve content that is managed by Sitecore. The framework offers both Objective-C and JavaScriptAPI that enable developers to rapidly develop applications utilising their existing IOS or web development skill sets. The SDK includes the following features:

 * Left-Right swipe navigation
 * Access to the camera and the photo library
 * QR code usage (scan and use QR Codes)
 * Accelerometer functions
 * Device information
 * Access to the built-in address book and easy creation of new contacts
 * Sending emails using the e-mail account
 * Social networks integration (Facebook, Twitter)
 * Mapping integration (with both Apple Maps and Google Maps)


The applications powered by this SDK support both **iOS 6** and **iOS 7**, and can request content from Sitecore efficiently and securely via [Sitecore Item Web API][2] RESTful web service.

You can also download a sample application that can be used as a starting point to understand the Mobile SDK for iOS and the features available. This project can be found in a corresponding [github repository][6]

Documentation, including installation and developer guides can be found on the [Sitecore Developer Network (SDN)][3]


## Framework Structure
The Sitecore Mobile SDK consists of three primary modules. They are

* **SitecoreMobileSDK.framework** – a set of core classes that interact with the [Sitecore Item Web Api][2] service.
* **SitecoreMobileJavaScript.framework** – a library that allows using native features of iOS in mobile optimized Sitecore renderings. It contains an **enhanced web view** and **web plug-ins**.
* **SitecoreMobileUI.framework** – UI extensions on top of **SitecoreMobileSDK.framework**. It contains a map view capable of building path and a self-loading image view.


The frameworks have some dependencies between each other. The dependencies are described in the following diagram :
